An immersive online tactical turn-based card game, set in the enchanting fantasy world of Avarik Saga.

<!-- more -->

"Prototype Swift" is designed to be a fast-paced mobile tactical game with deep strategy that uses simultaneous turn system and card-based skill system. 

After careful consideration, the design of this prototype was revamped and refined into the game [Red Covenant]({{ "/en/works/red-covenant" | relative_url }}).

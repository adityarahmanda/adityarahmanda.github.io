During my two years at ForgeFun, having the opportunity to work on Red Covenant from the ground up has been a privilege. I’ve encountered many challenges and valuable lessons throughout the process.

My primary role in this project was gameplay character implementation. I was responsible for integrating character Spine animations, 3D models, and VFX into the game, as well as creating the behavior trees that control character actions during combat. In addition to this, I contributed to the development of core combat mechanics such as the Ability System, Modifier System, and Aiming System.

All of these aspects were essential in bringing the character visuals to life while ensuring that the gameplay was fun and engaging. Here are a few clips of my work in action featured in the official Red Covenant YouTube channel.

Besides character implementation, I was also actively involved implementing the UI for various Red Covenant features. Here are some of the key visual of my work on UI.

Looking back at Red Covenant, I experienced significant personal growth and had the chance to expand my knowledge in game development. I gained hands-on experience with various key areas, including:

- Addressables Implementation
- Localization Implementation
- Google Sign In Implementation
- Analytics Implementation
- A/B Testing Implementation
- WebGL Deployment, and much more.

All of these experiences have undoubtedly become valuable assets for my career in the future.

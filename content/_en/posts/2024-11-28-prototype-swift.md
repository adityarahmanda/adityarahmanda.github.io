An immersive online tactical turn-based card game, set in the enchanting fantasy world of Avarik Saga.

<!--excerpt-->

"Prototype Swift" is designed to be a fast-paced mobile tactical game with deep strategy that uses simultaneous turn system and card-based skill system. 

After careful consideration, the design of this prototype was revamped and refined into the game [Red Covenant](https://avariksaga.com/redcovenant/).

Though the project was short, it was an invaluable experience that allowed me to dive deeper into Unity Networking using Photon Engine.

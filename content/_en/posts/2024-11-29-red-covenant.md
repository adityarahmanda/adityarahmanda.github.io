<!--excerpt-->

Over the course of two years, I had the privilege of working on Red Covenant from the ground up in ForgeFun, playing a key role in shaping the game while facing challenges that pushed my skills and expanded my knowledge as a game developer.

My primary role in this project was gameplay character implementation. I was responsible for integrating character Spine animations, 3D models, and VFX into the game, as well as creating the behavior trees that control character actions during combat. These tasks were crucial in bringing the characters to life and ensuring the gameplay was both appealing and engaging.

In addition to this, I took an active role in building the Ability System, a core component of Red Covenant’s combat mechanics. I designed a flexible system to support various character abilities, developed the Combat Modifier System to manage buffs, debuffs, and status effects, and created the Aiming System to ensure smooth and accurate targeting for players.

I’m really proud of how it all turned out! You can see some of my work in action in the official Red Covenant YouTube channel:

Looking back at Red Covenant, I’m incredibly proud of what we accomplished as a team. Personally, I’ve grown in ways I never imagined, learning new tools and techniques that will continue to shape my career.

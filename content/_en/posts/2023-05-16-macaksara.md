Javanese script reading quiz web app that represents my personal aspiration to support the preservation of the Javanese script, which is increasingly fading in the face of modern era.

The questions and answer choices in Macaksara were generated using a transliterator script I previously developed on [Alih Aksara]({{"/en/works/alih-aksara", | relative_url }})​.

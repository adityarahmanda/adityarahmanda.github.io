Brawl Shooter is a prototype game inspired by the design of Brawl Stars. It was created as a learning project to explore  multiplayer online functionality in Unity using Photon Fusion during my time at Joyseed Gametribe.

This top-down shooter features a simple lobby system, weapon equipment mechanics, and shooting/aiming systems similar found in Brawl Stars, offering a fun and engaging experience while demonstrating core multiplayer online mechanics.
